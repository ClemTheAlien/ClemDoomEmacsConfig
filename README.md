## Clem'S Doom Emacs Config

I know right now the config is bare-bones. I personally love DOOM Emacs as it combines the novel nature and philopshy of Emacs with Vim Keybindings. I like Emacs design philosphy a lot as I like the idea of a jack-of-all-trades application.

If I were to pick between vanilla Emacs or Vim, I'll go Emacs everyday

Emacs>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Vim

~~I understand if people like the simplicity of Vim. This is just my opinion.~~
